## 🔧 Setup Your WhatsApp Number

### Step 1: Update Admin WhatsApp Number

Open `/src/components/OrderForm.tsx` and find this line (around line 24):

```typescript
const adminWhatsAppNumber = "27663621868"; // Change this to your actual number
```

**Replace with your actual WhatsApp number** in international format:

- ✅ **South Africa:** `27` + your number (remove leading 0)
  - Example: `066 362 1868` becomes `27663621868`
- ✅ **International:** Country code + number
  - USA: `1` + number
  - UK: `44` + number
  - etc.

### Step 2: Test It!

1. Go to http://localhost:8180
2. Fill out the order form
3. Click "Place Order"
4. Review the confirmation dialog
5. Click "Confirm & Place Order"
6. WhatsApp should open automatically with the message!

## 📱 WhatsApp Message Format:

The admin will receive:

```
🔔 NEW PIE ORDER!

📋 ORDER #A1B2C3D4

👤 Customer: John Doe
📞 Phone: 066 362 1868
📧 Email: john@example.com

🥧 Quantity: 2 pie(s)
💵 Total: R60

📍 Delivery Address:
123 Main Street, City

💳 Payment: Cash on Delivery
Customer paying with: R100 | Change needed: R40

📝 Notes: Please ring the doorbell
```

---

## 🎨 Customization Options:

### Change the Message Format

Edit the `sendWhatsAppNotification` function in `OrderForm.tsx`:

```typescript
const message = `🔔 NEW PIE ORDER!
... your custom format here ...`;
```

### Add Multiple Admin Numbers

```typescript
// Send to multiple admins
const adminNumbers = ["27663621868", "27123456789"];
adminNumbers.forEach((number) => {
  const whatsappUrl = `https://wa.me/${number}?text=${encodeURIComponent(
    message
  )}`;
  window.open(whatsappUrl, "_blank");
});
```

### Disable WhatsApp (keep database notification only)

Comment out this line in `confirmAndSubmitOrder`:

```typescript
// sendWhatsAppNotification(newOrder);  // Disabled
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes:

✅ **Safe:** Opening WhatsApp with pre-filled message
✅ **Safe:** Storing orders in database
✅ **Privacy:** Customer's WhatsApp is NOT opened
✅ **Control:** Admin can choose to send message or not

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### WhatsApp doesn't open

- Check the number format (international format required)
- Make sure WhatsApp Web is installed
- Try on mobile device (works better)

### Multiple windows opening

- This is normal if you added multiple admin numbers
- Each window is a separate WhatsApp chat

### Customer sees error

- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify database is working (orders should still save)
- WhatsApp is optional - orders work without it!

## 🎯 Next Steps:

You can also integrate:

- 📧 Email notifications (using Supabase Edge Functions)
- 📲 SMS notifications (using Twilio)
- 🔔 Push notifications (using Firebase)
- 📞 Phone call notifications (using Twilio Voice)
