- is_read: BOOLEAN (default false)

```

When an order is placed, admin receives a notification like this:

```
üîî NEW PIE ORDER RECEIVED!

üë§ Customer: John Doe
üìû Phone: 066 362 1868
üìß Email: john@example.com

ü•ß Quantity: 3 pie(s)
üíµ Total: R90

üìç Delivery Address:
123 Main Street, City, 1234

üí≥ Payment Method: Cash on Delivery
üíµ Customer paying with: R100
üí∞ Change needed: R10

üìù Special Instructions:

Order ID: abc-123-def
```

## How It Works

### Order Flow:

1. **Customer fills out order form** on website
2. **Order is submitted** to Supabase database
3. **Notification is automatically created** with all order details
4. **Admin receives:**
   - Toast notification in admin panel
   - Bell icon badge count increases
   - Detailed notification in notification panel
5. **Admin can:**
   - View all notifications
   - Mark notifications as read
   - See order details directly in notification

### Real-Time Updates:

- Uses **Supabase Realtime subscriptions**
- Admin receives notifications instantly without page refresh
