# ✅ Migration Setup Complete!

## 📋 Summary

Since you switched from **Lovable Cloud** to **Manual Development**:

### ❌ What WON'T Happen Automatically:

- Database migrations are **NOT** applied when you run `npm run dev`
- Running the dev server only starts your React app frontend
- Database changes must be pushed separately to Supabase

### ✅ What You Need to Do:

Apply migrations manually using one of the methods below

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Apply Migration NOW

### **Method 1: Interactive Script** (Easiest)

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

This opens a menu with multiple options to apply the migration.

### **Method 2: Direct Dashboard** (Recommended)

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/orokbjfkklzlwbcweaja/sql/new
2. Copy content from: `APPLY_THIS_SQL.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Done! ✅

### **Method 3: CLI (One-time setup)**

```bash
# First time: Link project (needs DB password)
npm run db:link

# Then: Push migrations
npm run db:push
```

## 🔄 Your New Workflow

```bash
# Start development server (frontend only)
npm run dev

# When you create/need to apply database migrations
npm run db:migrate     # Interactive helper
# OR
npm run db:push        # Direct push (after linking)
```

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Apply the current migration** using one of the methods above
2. **Verify** in Supabase Dashboard that `admin_notifications` table exists
3. **Test** by placing an order - admin should receive notification!

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Commit migrations to git** so your team can apply them
- **Always test locally** before pushing to production
- **Use `npm run db:push`** for faster workflow (after initial setup)
